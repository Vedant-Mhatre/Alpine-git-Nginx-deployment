# Nginx-Docker-web-deployment
Hosting a simple static website inside docker using nginx by using a Dockerfile to create image

What is Docker and why I used instead of directly installing nginx on host?

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy and run applications by using containers.

Containers work a slightly like VMs, but in a far more specific and granular way. They isolate a single application and its dependencies both from the underlying operating system and from other containers.

Docker containers provide a way to get a grip on software. You can use Docker to wrap up an application in such a way that its deployment and runtime issues are handled outside of the application itself, and in a way that is consistent across all "containerized" apps.

In addition, Docker has been designed in a way that it can be incorporated into most DevOps applications, including Puppet, Chef, Vagrant, and Ansible, or it can be used on its own to manage development environments.
Benefits of using docker:

1. More efficient use of system resources

2. Faster software delivery cycles

3. Application portability

4. Makes implementing microservices architecture easier
